1. What did I accomplish yesterday?

Fixed the Google Contacts integration for contact updates.

Resolved the issue where contact names were appearing as "No Name".

Updated GoogleContactsService.java to correctly use givenName and displayName when adding or updating contacts.

Verified that edit and update functionalities reflect changes in actual Google Contacts.

2. What will I do today?

Refactor and clean up the codebase (remove redundancies, improve error handling).

Ensure the UI/UX is consistent across all views (add/edit/list).

Implement support for additional fields (e.g., birthday, organization).

Conduct end-to-end testing and push to GitHub.

3. Any blockers or challenges?

Still encountering occasional Whitelabel Error Page with unclear logs.

Need to confirm scope for additional fields with the team.

Might require adjustments for Google People API quota or permissions.
