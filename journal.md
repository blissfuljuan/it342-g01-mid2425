What I learned in Git:
Git is a powerful version control system that helps track changes in code projects. Key concepts include commits (snapshots of changes), branches (parallel development lines), merges (combining changes), and remotes (like GitHub, for collaboration). I learned how to initialize a repo, stage files, commit changes, create branches, and push to a remote repository.

One question or confusion I still have:
How do I best resolve complex merge conflicts when multiple files have overlapping changes? Is there a recommended workflow or tool that simplifies this process beyond manual edits?
