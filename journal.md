**What I learned today:**  
I learned how to use the basic Git commands like `git init`, `git commit`, and `git push`. I now understand how to track changes in a local repository and push them to GitHub.

**What I'm still confused about:**  
I'm still unsure when to use the staging area vs committing directly. Also, how do I remove a file that was accidentally added?
