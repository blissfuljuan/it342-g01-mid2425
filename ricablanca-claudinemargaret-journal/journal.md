What I learned in Git:
Git is a powerful version control system that helps track changes in code projects. Key concepts include commits (snapshots of changes), branches (parallel development lines), merges (combining changes), and remotes (like GitHub, for collaboration). I learned how to initialize a repo, stage files, commit changes, create branches, and push to a remote repository.

One question or confusion I still have:
How do I best resolve complex merge conflicts when multiple files have overlapping changes? Is there a recommended workflow or tool that simplifies this process beyond manual edits?

What I learned in Git:
I learned about the importance of branching and how to use branches to work on features independently without affecting the main codebase. I also practiced using commands like git checkout, git merge, and git rebase to manage branches effectively and keep the commit history clean.

One question or confusion I still have:
What’s the practical difference between git merge and git rebase, and when should I prefer one over the other in a team project?

What I learned in Git:
I learned how to use .gitignore files to exclude certain files or directories from being tracked by Git. This is useful for keeping sensitive information or build artifacts out of the repository and maintaining a clean version history.

One question or confusion I still have:
If I accidentally committed sensitive files before adding them to .gitignore, what’s the best way to remove them completely from the Git history?
