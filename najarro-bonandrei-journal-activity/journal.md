#### What I learned in Git
Despite having previous experiences with Git from personal and educational projects, we learned the proper execution (like the do's and dont's) of using Git itself and its commands or features. Like not using Windows Powershell when executing  Git commands, and the importance of the .git folder and its impact to your project.

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
I am still not confident and sure when dealing with branches and dealing with the HEAD concept in Git.
