#### What I learned in Git
Despite having previous experiences with Git from personal and educational projects, we learned the proper execution (like the do's and dont's) of using Git itself and its commands or features. Like not using Windows Powershell when executing  Git commands, and the importance of the .git folder and its impact to your project.

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
I am still not confident and sure when dealing with branches and dealing with the HEAD concept in Git.

#### What I learned in Git
I learned the importance of using Git as a way to synchronize my progress between two devices. I am having a personal coding project related to my work as a Non-Academic scholar of CIT. Since I am working on my personal computer and my laptop, I used Git through Github to have synchronized files between two devices. This is very useful since it removes the effort of having to manually transfer files between my devices.

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
As of writing this, I did not have a thing I am confused with Git yet.
