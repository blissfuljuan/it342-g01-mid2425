#### What I learned in Git
Despite having previous experiences with Git from personal and educational projects, we learned the proper execution (like the do's and dont's) of using Git itself and its commands or features. Like not using Windows Powershell when executing  Git commands, and the importance of the .git folder and its impact to your project.

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
I am still not confident and sure when dealing with branches and dealing with the HEAD concept in Git.

#### What I learned in Git
I learned the importance of using Git as a way to synchronize my progress between two devices. I am having a personal coding project related to my work as a Non-Academic scholar of CIT. Since I am working on my personal computer and my laptop, I used Git through Github to have synchronized files between two devices. This is very useful since it removes the effort of having to manually transfer files between my devices.

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
As of writing this, I did not have a thing I am confused with Git yet.

#### What I learned in Git
Today, I learned how to fork a repository. In my understanding, basically its re-creating an existing repository and saving it as your own copy of that repository. I'm assuming that it's similar to making a branch in Git. But instead of handling with branches, you are dealing with repositories itself. 

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
I am confused and slightly wondering what will happen when the owner of the existing repository adds an update to their repo (they pushed new commits), can we update our own fork of the repo with the changes they added? If so, how will it affect our forked repository?
