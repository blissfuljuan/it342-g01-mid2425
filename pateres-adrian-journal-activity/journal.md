Journal Entry #3
Entry 3 - June 22, 2025
What I learned in Git:
I learned about the basic Git workflow: add, commit, and push. I now understand that git add stages files for commit, git commit saves the changes to my local repository with a descriptive message, and git push uploads those changes to GitHub. I also learned that you need to be in the correct directory structure when working with Git commands, and that creating meaningful commit messages is important for tracking project history.
One question or confusion I still have:
I'm curious about Git branches and when I should use them. I've heard about creating separate branches for different features, but I don't understand how to create them or when it's necessary. Is it always better to work on a separate branch, or is working directly on the main branch okay for simple projects like this journal?
