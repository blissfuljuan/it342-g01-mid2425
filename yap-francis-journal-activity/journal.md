1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
 
I added the necessary Spring Boot dependencies: Web, OAuth2 Client, Thymeleaf.
 
I started working on the controller to manage Google OAuth login and callback.
 
I successfully set up the application.properties with my OAuth client ID and secret.
 
 
2. What will I do today?
 
I will complete the controller code to exchange the auth code for an access token.
 
I will call the People API (people/me/connections) and display contact names and emails in a Thymeleaf view.

Fix Controller and Service Setup as well as the necessary import dependencies in the pom.xml
 
I will test the login flow and data display while handling error with contacts
 
 
3. Any blockers or challenges?
 
Still validating that the access token works properly with the People API.
 
Small issue with handling error states if a user cancels authorization.
